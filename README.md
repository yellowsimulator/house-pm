# Assumptions for the simulated data

## Age:
Older houses usually have higher maintenance costs due to wear and tear.
Condition usually deteriorates with age.

## Material:
High-quality material would lead to a lower maintenance cost.
High-quality material would usually mean the house is in a better condition.

## Size:
Bigger houses may have higher maintenance costs due to a larger area to maintain.
Size may indirectly affect the condition through increased maintenance needs.

## Tenant Behavior:
Bad tenant behavior (higher values) might increase the maintenance cost.
Poor tenant behavior can deteriorate the house condition.

## Maintenance Frequency:
The more frequent the maintenance, the lower the overall maintenance cost might be.
Frequent maintenance should mean the house is in a better condition.

## Budget Constraints:
Having budget constraints might lead to cheaper, hence possibly less effective, maintenance work, increasing the overall maintenance cost.
Budget constraints might lead to poorer house condition over time.

## Previous Maintenance Quality:
Higher quality maintenance would lead to a lower future maintenance cost.
Previous maintenance quality would directly affect the house condition.

## Bathrooms:
The more bathrooms, the higher the potential maintenance cost, considering plumbing and fixtures.
More bathrooms might mean a slightly better condition if they are well-maintained.

## Location:
Urban locations might have higher maintenance costs due to pollution or more wear and tear. Rural houses might have lower costs due to a more lenient environment, but might suffer from other factors like pests or moisture.

## Has Garage:
Houses with garages might have slightly higher maintenance costs due to the additional structure.
A garage might improve house condition as it provides protection for certain assets or parts of the property.

## Rooms:
Houses with more rooms might have higher maintenance costs due to more areas to look after.
More rooms could either mean a better or worse condition depending on maintenance. A larger house that's poorly maintained could be in worse condition than a smaller, well-maintained house.



# testing the code

## 1 - install requirmemts (pip install -r requirments.txt)
## 2 - run training.py file (python training.py)
## 3 - rum mlflow ui --port 9999, to open mflow ui
